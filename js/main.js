// 2019, 2022 figures estimate 5% increase as per https://www.worldometers.info/world-population
// older figures from 1990's, 1.05% rate.
// We are saying 1 birth every 8 seconds, one death every 12 seconds, so population increases by 1 every 24 seconds.
// There are about Ï€e+7 (30 million-ish) seconds in a year, which makes about 1.3 million increase per year.
// This would be agrowth rate of about .1666%
// However, Worldometer suggests 81 million increase per year, or a ~1.05% growth rate.
// Population growth peaked in the 1970s and has been falling off ever since.
